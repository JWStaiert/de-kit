# Notes regarding Vulkan Layers 

To change the layer search path of the vulkan loader without modifying system paths or
directories set environment variable VK_LAYER_PATH to a list of directories. While this
variable is defined only those paths will be searched for layers. On Windows, paths
should be seperated by a semi-colon (;) while on Linux and macOS use colon (:).

To force layers to be used by an application set VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS to a list of layer
names. On Windows the layer names should be seperated by a semi-colon (;) while on
Linux and mac OS use colon (:).
